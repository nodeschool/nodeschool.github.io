The `nodeschool-sticker-guide.ai` file has instructions for making your own sticker of this style. It looks exactly like the image above.

All type has been turned into shapes so no need to worry about having the right font. Also, the letters have already been rotated for you, too! Follow the guide to change colors and bottom letters to your liking!

I've down-saved it to CS2, but let me know if another version (or another kind of change) would work better by opening an [issue](http://www.github.com/nodeschool/nodeschool.github.io/issues). Yay!
