Please make sure your pull request/feature request takes into account the following contribution guidelines:

- Publishing this repo will trigger a `npm run deploy` and publish the website to the `master` branch.
- This project is managed by volunteers, and it's important that we keep things as simple as possible and as easy to maintain as possible. When choosing between simplicity and complexity we will probably choose simplicity, even if the complex solution is more theoretically correct. For example, our current translation system isn't as SEO friendly as a more complex solution, but our solution is much simpler. This is a tradeoff that is worth it to us because it keeps things more maintainable.
- Smaller pull requests (one for each feature) are likely to get merged more quickly than huge pull requests that bundle together multiple features.
- If you are in the `nodeschool/owners` team, feel free to commit simple changes directly to master. Examples of simple changes are translation fixes, typos etc. However, since changes to master get deployed live to `nodeschool.io` immediately, please open a pull request for any changes that you are unsure of or want feedback on.
